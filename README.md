The Point-to-Pixel (P2P) prompting framework is an advanced and integrated approach designed to achieve high-quality 3D reconstructions by converting 3D point clouds into 2D images while maintaining geometric fidelity. This framework incorporates various state-of-the-art techniques and models, optimizing each stage of the transformation process to ensure both accuracy and visual quality
